====================================================
version 1.21
1. first version supporting qos
 
version 1.22  
1. fix vlan editing bug.  Last version, it will automatically insert 2 inner vlan when only one inner vlan insert is required

NO version 1.23

version 1.24
1. fix wfq not accurate bug: 
	rate shaping involved in wfq algo, which will block the high priotiry queue with large size packet.

====================================================
PPE firmware for VR9 E1
====================================================
version 0.23
1. Add QoS functions for E1. (No Port based shaping in E1)

version 0.24
1. Fix QoS bug for E1. Last version, ppe firmware will overwrite register 2012 and crash descriptor.
   This version needs driver  not setting ETH1_QSS of register 2012 in PTM mode, because D5 firmware will do QoS if this was set to Firmware mode.

NO version 0.25

version 0.26
1. Fix WFQ bug for E1. Last version, ppe directly use the D reload codes of D5. But in E5, all 8 dispatch queus were mapped to 4 garma interface, that means
		       The queues might me divided into 4 groups and the reload must work in a certain group one time. unfortunately, D5 reload function do			    don't have any idea of these groups and would reload in all 8 queues at the same times. 

NO version 0.27 (debugging version for flowcontrol with GPIO)

version 0.28
1. Workaround for TC syn issue for HW bug

version 0.29
1. firmware workaround for RTHA bitmap bug and enable workaround (with threshold = 64, byte_shift = 32) by default.

version 0.30
1. merge flowcontrol with GPIO and workaround for RTHA bitmap bug.
   #define GPIO_ADDR                  SB_BUFFER(0x2019)
   #define GPIO_MODE                  SB_BUFFER(0x201C)
   #define GPIO_WM_CFG                SB_BUFFER(0x201D)

version 0.31
1. add QoS time_tick shadow register to support dynamic PPE clock change

version 0.32
1. Change QoS tx swap descriptor number from 64 to 32. alignment with driver and spec.
